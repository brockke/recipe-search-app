# Recipe Search

A fairly simple UI that queries the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) api and displays recipe information.

You can try it out [here.](https://recipe-search-app-brockke.vercel.app/)

## What's it made with?

Initalized with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Uses [TanStack&nbsp;Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to handle the api and [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) for routing.
